\subsection{Hahn Echo} \label{B5}

\begin{comment}
\begin{itemize}
\item talk about what the hahn echo is and how we're measuring it \textbf{(10 mins)}
\item Show how you found the magnetization data points for one of the samples ****this involves probably shifting the graphs up so that they approach 0****  (show a plot with a labeled data point) \textbf{(10 min)}
\item find the magnetization data points for each of the graphs and uncertainties \textbf{(15 mins)}
\item plot the values obtained for each of the samples, include a graph with error bars (the uncertainties from above), there should be horiziontial and vertical bars because we're approximating both the time and voltage. given units and a title. \textbf{(15 mins)}
\item fit an exp to each plot and say which function and language you're using \textbf{(15 mins)}
\item say the coefficients of the each fit and the uncertainties \textbf{(10 mins)}
\item show a sample calculation for $T_2$ and its uncertainty \textbf{(10 mins)}
\item talk about each of the fits, causes for errors etc. and the physics for why the $T_2$'s may be different \textbf{(15 mins)}

The raw data collected from the spectrometer was zero-shifted and smoothed using a simple Gaussian filtering procedure (see Appendix \ref{append:process}). The peak magnetization of the echo decays as,
\begin{align*}
    M(t) &= M_0 e^{-t/T_2}\\
    \intertext{Similar to previous sections, taking the natural logarithm and rearranging,}
    \ln \left( M(t) \right) &= \frac{-t}{T_2} + \ln(M_0) \numberthis \label{eqn:B5:log}
\end{align*}

Figure \ref{fig:B5:fit/trace} shows each trace with different time-delays and the calculated echo amplitude. These amplitudes are plotted against $t=2\tau$ in Figure \ref{fig:B5:expcurve}, along with the fit -- which was determined using a linear least squares regression of the data, using the form from Equation \ref{eqn:B5:log}. From the fit, the $T_2$ value is the slope of the line, and the uncertainty is the 95\% confidence interval of the least squares algorithm. The $T_2$ values for doped water, ethanol and rubber are summarized in Table \ref{tab:B5:T2vals}.

As expected from Equation \ref{eqn:Hanecho}, 
\[ 1/T^*_2 = 1/T_2 + \gamma \Delta B_o \]
all values of $T_2$ are greater than that of $T_2^*$ (Table \ref{tab:B2:T2*_values}). Using these two terms, it is straightforward to calculate the $\gamma\Delta B_o$ values for each sample. As $\gamma$ is constant for each sample (the gyromagnetic ratio of a proton) then from Table \ref{tab:B5:hom} we can compare the relative field inhomogeneities of each sample. We can see that rubber has greater field inhomogeneities than the liquid sample ethanol by a factor of approximately two. The rubber sample used here, a pencil eraser, likely has manufacturing impurities and spatial differences in density and chemical composition -- compared to a highly pure sample of ethanol. Thus, it is consistent with our knowledge of the samples that the field inhomogeneities of rubber are greater than the other two samples.
