\subsection{Comparison of Rubber and Ethanol}

Here we briefly discuss some of the results and how they apply to the three samples. Note that the doped water is essentially a calibration sample as it has been modified to increase its signal. Hence we will investigate the differences between ethanol and rubber.\\

In analyzing these results, we can conclude that the time constants for ethanol are an order of magnitude larger than that of a rubber. The typical designation of ``rubber'' commonly refer to a class of polymers known as elastomers (although this is not completely accurate in specific cases \cite{polydict}). These elastomers have high molecular mobility and narrow NMR lines due to their weak intermolecular forces between their polymer chains,  \cite{NMRpoly}. These characteristics make them ideal for pulse NMR spectroscopy as the high molecular mobility has been linked to lower $T_1$ and $T_2$ times, which has been verified in references \cite{polyT1, polyT}. This lowering of $T_1$ and $T_2$ based off of molecular mobility is due to the fact that interactions in general increase with an increase of molecular mobility. These interactions can be molecular collisions, which affect $T_1$ or higher fluctuations in local fields which affect $T_2$.\\

However in comparison the dominant intermolecular force present in ethanol is hydrogen bonding, which is a strong force, which directly leads to a decrease of molecular mobility and hence an increase in both $T_1$ and $T_2$.\\
